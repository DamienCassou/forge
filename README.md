Work with Git forges from the comfort of Magit
==============================================

Work with Git forges, such as Github and Gitlab, from the comfort
of Magit and the rest of Emacs.

Only Github is fully supported at the moment.  The schema of the
database has not been finalized yet.  Until that has happened it
will occationally have to be discard.  For now the database does
not contain any information that cannot simply be fetched again.
