* v0.2.0    UNRELEASED

- For the time being ~forge-pull~ does not pull notifications anymore.
  Many reported bugs are related to notifications and while many of
  those have already been fixed, pulling notifications is still more
  likely to contain bugs than other more essential functionality
  because we have to work around limitations in the Github API to do
  so.

  To fetch notifications use the command ~forge-pull-notifications~ or
  customize the option ~forge-pull-notifications~.  47671ca

- Added support for Gitlab subgroups.  #11

- Added support for issue and pull-request templates.  #25

- Added the command ~forge-copy-url-at-point-as-kill~.  #85

- When visiting an unmerged pull-request in a separate buffer, then
  the commits are now listed alongside the posts.  caeb8fb

- Added ~turn-on-flyspell~ to ~forge-post-mode-hook~.  bd07eec

- Fixed several bugs.  Some of these were silly mistakes in Forge
  itself, while others were due to API bugs that we weren't aware
  of and therefore did not work around yet.
