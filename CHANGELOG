* v0.3.2    2022-03-07

- The command ~forge-toggle-display-in-status-buffer~ now affects all
  relevant sections. #470

- It is possible to create a pull-request from an existing issue
  again.  #473

* v0.3.1    2022-02-16

- Added several existing commands to ~forge-dispatch~.

- Added new option ~forge-add-default-sections~, which can be set to ~nil~
  to prevent Forge from adding bindings to Magit keymaps and transient
  prefix commands.

- Added new command ~forge-browse-repository~.  #443

- Added new variable ~forge-format-avatar-function~.  #447

- Added support for the ~sqlite-builtin~ and ~sqlite-module~ backends.
  See https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql/pull/86.

- Added new option ~forge-checkout-worktree-read-directory-function~.
  #463

- Also included are many other improvements, updated documentation and
  bugfixes.

* v0.3.0    2021-10-14

- Many actions that were surprisingly slow are much faster now,
  because an embarrassing bottleneck was removed in Closql v1.2.0.

- Added new option ~forge-database-connector~ allowing the use of other
  database connector libraries beside ~emacsql-sqlite~ (currently only
  ~emacsql-libsqlite3~ (experimental) and ~emacsql-sqlite3~ (discouraged)).
  bae6a527, 21720580

- Commands that take a topic or repository as argument now expect an
  object/row ID instead of an object or a number.  Objects are not
  suitable as interactive arguments because their printed
  representation would be presented to the user when using
  ~repeat-complex-command~, and because they might not reflect the
  current state when used like that.  Numbers would be more readable
  and actually meaningful to humans, but additionally they would be
  ambiguous.  Non-interactive functions continue to expect objects
  as arguments.  #368

- Some essential key bindings that were somewhat randomly selected
  during initial development have now been changed for consistency,
  which I always intended to do, but did not get around to do until
  now.  ~forge-dispatch~ is now bound to ~N~ instead of ~'~ and Forge's
  bindings in ~magit-fetch~ and ~magit-pull~ now use ~N~ and ~n~ instead of
  ~Y~ and ~y~.  ~N~ was chosen because it was one of the last alphabetic
  keys available at the top-level in Magit.  8c9614e3 et al.

- Added new command ~forge-merge~ for merging pull-requests using the
  forge's API, which I recommend you only use if someone forces you
  to do use the API.  3112aded

- Added support for following the links that some projects on Github
  display alongside issue templates.  46d5f253

- Setting the new Git variable ~forge.autoPull~ to false disables
  pulling Git data whenever API data is fetched.  This may be useful
  in active mono-repos where there is always something new (but likely
  irrelevant) to pull.  #362

- Added new commands ~forge-list-labeled-pullreqs~ and
  ~forge-list-labeled-issues~.  a3e6f8aa

- Starting with Emacs 28 ~bug-references~ is automatically configure for
  repositories cloned from many Git forges, so Forge no longer has to
  do it.  #283, #412

- It is possible to fetch only select topics of a repository, which is
  useful if that happens to be large and/or if you are only interested
  in a select few topics (such as the one you are about to open).
  ~forge-pull~ learned to fetch information about the repository itself
  even when configured to only fetch certain topics.  #382

- Added the ~forge-browse-*~ commands to ~forge-dispatch~.  #422

- Also included are several other improvements, updated documentation
  and bugfixes.

* v0.2.1    2021-06-17

- Adjusted to breaking changes in EIEIO in Emacs 28.

* v0.2.0    2021-05-25

- I haven't been keeping this list updated and don't feel like going
  through hundreds of commits now.  Sorry, maybe next time.

* v0.1.0    2018-12-19

- Initial beta release.
